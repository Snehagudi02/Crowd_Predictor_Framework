## 🌟 Key Features

### 👁️ Intelligent Crowd Detection
- **Multi-Zone Monitoring:** Simultaneous tracking across 4 distinct zones (Zone A, B, C, D) with independent configurations.
- **Optimized YOLOv8:** Custom-tuned object detection pipeline for precise head and person tracking even in dense environments.
- **High Performance:** Real-time frame processing with asynchronous API communication.

### 📈 Predictive Intelligence
- **Hybrid Forecasting:** Combines **Multi-Variate LSTM** (Temporal patterns) and **Facebook Prophet** (Seasonality) for high-accuracy predictions (~85%+).
- **Risk Outlook:** Forecasts peak crowd sizes and risk durations to assist in proactive resource deployment.
- **Live Analytics:** Dynamic actual-vs-predicted trajectory graphs powered by Plotly.

### 🚨 Smart Alerting System
- **Real-time Thresholds:** Adjustable capacity limits per zone via the dashboard.
- **Automated Alerts:** Visual indicators and automated email notifications (via SMTP) when density exceeds safe thresholds.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** A premium, dark-themed dashboard built with Streamlit for a modern operator experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Snehagudi02/Crowd_Predictor_Framework.git
cd Crowd_Predictor_Framework

# Install dependencies (Unified or per service)
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Email Alert Credentials
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=recipient@example.com
ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=sender@example.com
ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
ALERT_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
ALERT_SMTP_PORT=465

# Global Settings
MAX_CAPACITY=50
ALERT_EMAIL_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=60
```

---

## 💻 Running the Application

The system operates as a decoupled architecture. **Both services must be active.**

### Step 1: Start the Backend (API & AI Inference)
```bash
# From the root directory
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend (Dashboard)
```bash
# From the root directory in a new terminal
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
The project includes a robust testing suite for ensuring reliability of detection and prediction logic.
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/
```
